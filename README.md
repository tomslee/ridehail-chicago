# The ridehail market in Chicago

The City of Chicago requires Transportation Network Providers (sometimes called rideshare companies) to provide it with data as part of the licensing process and routine reporting required by ordinance. The City then makes this data available through its Open Data Portal. This is one of the few significant open data sets about ridehail markets (a term I prefer to "rideshare") and systems available. Thank you, City of Chicago.

This repo collects some summaries of that data which I find interesting, in the *data* folder. It also contains R notebooks that plot some charts from this. So far I have been updating this monthly, and I hope to continue doing so.
